# Advent of Code 2017
## Day 7 Redux

This is a one-year-later revisit to one of my toughest days in 2017's AoC challenge. Along with updating my solution I will be using this repo to experiment with CMake and Catch2.

The testing in this repository relies on a locally CMake-built implementation of Catch2. The steps for doing this are found in the CMake integration doc of the Catch2 repository.
